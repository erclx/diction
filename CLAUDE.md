# Diction

Local, offline pronunciation-training tool. FastAPI speech pipeline in `backend/`, Vite and React UI in `frontend/`, with shared tooling and governance at the repo root.

## Context

The project uses a three-tier context model. Know which tier holds what before reading or writing:

- Always loaded: root `CLAUDE.md`, `.claude/REQUIREMENTS.md`, `.claude/ARCHITECTURE.md`, and the `.claude/context/index.md` and `.claude/wireframes/index.md` discovery anchors. Project-wide invariants, product scope, and the anchors for on-demand domain and surface context.
- Path-scoped lazy: `.claude/rules/*.md` with `paths:` frontmatter. Coding standards that load only when files matching the glob are touched. Always-on rules apply every session.
- On-demand lookup: `.claude/context/<domain>.md` entries and `.claude/wireframes/<surface>.md` surfaces. Per-domain narrative and per-surface layout, loaded only when that domain or surface is touched. Use the always-loaded `.claude/context/index.md` and `.claude/wireframes/index.md` to pick which to read. Entries are populated by `claude-docs` at ship time.

@.claude/REQUIREMENTS.md
@.claude/ARCHITECTURE.md
@.claude/context/index.md
@.claude/wireframes/index.md

## Behavior

- Flag concerns or alternatives when a proposed change has tradeoffs worth discussing.
- When facing a judgment call with 2-3 reasonable options mid-flow, pick one and state the tradeoff in one sentence. Enumerate options only when the user's preference is the deciding factor.
- Match edit scope to the request. Ship minimal v1 and queue extensions as follow-ups.
- On simplification requests, edit only what the user named.
- Do not add features the user did not ask for.
- When rewriting a section, preserve existing code blocks, tables, and grouped examples unless the user asked to remove them.
- When planning an edit to `CLAUDE.md`, show the proposed change as a fenced `diff` block in chat first, then wait for approval before calling `Edit`
- After implementing a UI change, start a worktree dev pair with `bun run dev:all` and share the printed localhost URL so the change can be verified in the browser. The pair is cleaned up on session end.

## Indexes

- When a folder has an `index.md`, check it before reading individual files in that folder.
- For folders where an agent browses to pick a document, `index.md` is regenerated from each file's frontmatter. Do not hand-edit `index.md`. Code folders and scratch folders do not need one.
- Every `index.md` carries its own frontmatter (`title`, `subtitle`) that the walker preserves. To keep a folder's `index.md` hand-edited, add `auto: false` to its frontmatter.

## Markdown

- When editing any markdown file, follow `.claude/standards/prose.md`.
- When writing or updating `.claude/context/<domain>.md`, also follow `.claude/standards/context.md`.
- When writing or updating `.claude/wireframes/<surface>.md`, also follow `.claude/standards/wireframes.md`.

## Commands

- Run `bun run check` before committing. Full script reference in `.claude/context/development.md`.
- `bun run dev:all` (or `scripts/dev.sh`) starts a frontend and backend pair, picking a free port pair per worktree and wiring `VITE_BACKEND_URL` automatically, so parallel worktrees do not collide. It defaults to the stub model stack. Set `DICTION_DEV_MODELS=real` to use installed models. Use `scripts/dev.sh restart` or `scripts/dev.sh stop` to manage this worktree's pair.

## Output

- After creating or modifying a file, include its path on its own line so terminal emulators can make it clickable. Do not paraphrase paths into prose ("the seeds folder", "your CLAUDE.md").
- Use the path the user's editor can resolve. The editor is rooted at the main project root.
- In the main worktree: relative from `pwd` works because `pwd` equals the editor root.
- In a linked worktree (under `.claude/worktrees/<name>/`): use absolute paths. Relative paths from worktree `pwd` would not resolve against the editor's project root.
- When the response covers multiple files, group paths under headers: `**Created:**`, `**Modified:**`, `**Deleted:**`. For single-file changes, the path on its own line is enough.

## Key paths

- `backend/`: FastAPI speech pipeline on Python, managed with `uv`
- `frontend/`: Vite, React, and TypeScript UI, managed with `bun`
- repo root: shared tooling, hooks, and CI for the whole repo. Each subtree owns only its language config
- `.claude/`: planning docs (requirements, architecture, design, tasks)
- `.claude/context/`: per-domain narrative (how a domain is structured, decisions, gotchas), indexed via `.claude/context/index.md`
- `.claude/wireframes/`: per-surface ASCII layouts loaded on demand, indexed via `.claude/wireframes/index.md`
- `.claude/rules/`: path-scoped coding standards loaded by Claude Code on file match
- `.claude/review/`: gitignored scratch for review and UI-test output, overwritten on each run

## Spelling

- When cspell flags a word, rewrite typos. Add real terms to the appropriate dictionary in `cspell.json`.
- Keep dictionary files sorted alphabetically.

## Snippets

- When a snippet is referenced with `@`, execute its instructions immediately using available session context.

## Tasks

- `.claude/TASKS.md` is gitignored local session scratch. Edit freely. No staging or revert before commits.
- Only create a task for work that spans multiple sessions or has real dependencies. Handle small edits immediately without a task entry.
- Do not add tasks retroactively for work already completed. Completed work is visible in git.
- When a task needs execution detail beyond `.claude/TASKS.md`, create a plan in `.claude/plans/` and link to it from the task block's intro paragraph. When that task ships, delete its plan file.
- Write the plan in the same session as the task block. The session that executes the plan later inherits reasoning context it would otherwise have to re-derive.

## Memory

- Write all memory files to `.claude/memory/`, not `~/.claude/projects/`.
- Save a feedback memory only when the same mistake happens twice in the session, or when the user explicitly corrects you. First-occurrence slips are noise.
- Keep feedback memories to 3 lines: the rule, a one-line Why, and a one-line How to apply. Capture the pattern, not the recovery narrative.
- Before creating a new memory file, check for an existing one on the same topic. Update rather than duplicate.

## Scratch

- Write temporary files to `.claude/.tmp/<slug>/<file>.md` in the project root. Use a kebab-slug tied to the topic. Never use `/tmp` or a flat `<slug>-<file>.md`.

## Worktrees

- Implementation work runs in a linked worktree. From the main worktree, enter one with `/claude-worktree` before editing tracked files for a feature.
- Do not leave tracked-file edits uncommitted in the main worktree. It is PR-gated, so land every change on a branch: fold it into an in-flight linked worktree, or open its own PR. When that worktree has a live session, hand it the edit to commit rather than writing across worktrees.
- Shared session scratch (`.claude/plans/`, `.claude/review/`, `.claude/memory/`, `.claude/TASKS.md`) lives at the main worktree root, not inside a linked worktree. From a linked worktree, resolve these paths against the main root via `git worktree list --porcelain | grep -m 1 '^worktree ' | cut -d' ' -f2-`. Fall back to `pwd` if not a git repo.
- From a linked worktree, every `Edit` or `Write` to a tracked file (source, docs) must use a path starting with `pwd`. Only shared session scratch (`.claude/plans/`, `.claude/review/`, `.claude/memory/`, `.claude/TASKS.md`) resolves to the main worktree root.
